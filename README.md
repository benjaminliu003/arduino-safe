# arduino-safe
This is code for an Arduino project of mine, originally made for school.
In case anyone would like to understand how it works, the code is commented and documentation is also in the repository

For testing, the system requires an arduino mega, a Node-MCU(ESP8266) networking chip, an a smartphone with the Blynk application.
