# arduino-safe
This is code for an Arduino project of mine, originally made for school.
In case anyone would like to understand how it works, the code is commented and documentation is also in the repository

For testing, the system requires an arduino mega, a Node-MCU(ESP8266) networking chip, an a smartphone with the Blynk application.

The code in both folders are needed, with the script in the Lock_System_Basic_V2_Commented being uploaded to the Arduino Mega and the scripts in the Network_Blynk_Test_Commented being uploaded to the NodeMCU chip.
